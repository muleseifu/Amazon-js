# Amazon Clone Checkout Page

This project is a simplified Amazon checkout page built with HTML and CSS, designed as a learning exercise for JavaScript. The goal is to practice and improve JavaScript skills by adding interactivity and dynamic features to the checkout process.

## Features
- Responsive Amazon-style checkout layout
- Product listing with images, prices, and quantity controls
- Delivery options for each product
- Order summary with itemized costs, shipping, tax, and total
- Clean, modular CSS structure

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `checkout.html` in your browser to view the static page.
3. All images and styles are included in the project folders.

## Next Steps (JavaScript Learning Goals)
- Make the cart interactive: update quantities, delete items, and recalculate totals
- Implement delivery option selection and update shipping costs dynamically
- Add form validation and user feedback
- Store cart data using localStorage or similar
- Simulate order placement and confirmation

## Folder Structure
- `checkout.html`, `amazon.html`, `orders.html`, `tracking.html`: Main HTML pages
- `styles/`: CSS files for layout and components
- `images/`: Product, icon, and logo images
- `backend/`, `data/`: Placeholder for product data (JSON/JS)

## Why This Project?
I'm using this project to learn and practice JavaScript by turning a static checkout page into a dynamic, interactive web application. All code is written for educational purposes.
